                                The committee noted with some dismay that since 1987 provision has been made for granting of U.G. Research awards to academic staff have fallen into oblivion. The committee guided by discussions with the various Faculties of the University makes the following recommendations.
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><p>That the awards for research rules which already exist be resuscitated and that the value of the prize be substantially increased to reflect the realities of the present day;</p></li>
                                    <li><p>and at the same time, the value of the cash award would be enhanced by the
                                    addition of a Plaque or medal of lasting value.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>That the University inaugurate a concomitant award for teaching, in the same broad areas as those for research awards, namely; agriculture, technology and natural sciences, human and social sciences.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>That in addition to the awards for research and teaching, consideration be given to awards for academic staff at the professional level, who have demonstrated outstanding productivity in research or teaching. The Committee recommends named - chair awards to this category of academic.</p></li>
                                </ol>

                                With respect to awards to non-academic staff, the committee looked at similar awards at other universities in the similar category and it is noted that these awards went beyond the mere considerations of long service to take in the ideas of excellence of service and a sound, demonstrable contribution to the advancement of the University.

                                Although this category was not included among the categories mentioned in the proposal, the committee examined the implications of the granting of Posthumous Awards, and it recommends that consideration be given to this category on the condition that a strict time limit be maintained between the passing of the personality and the granting of the award. The time limit recommended is "<b>not more than a year</b>”, from the time of consideration.

                                The Committee noted that the U.G. Guild of Graduates in Guyana had put in place a structure through which outstanding Alumni might be selected for awards. The committee acknowledge the work of the Guild and consider broadening the selection process to involve the overseas Guilds of Graduates, some of which are particularly strong. It felt that there was an urgent need for strengthening liaison between these Guilds and widening the net to include those countries where there is no Guild, but where University of Guyana graduates are nevertheless making an outstanding contribution to the communities.

                                <p>
                                The committee recommends that the Honoring of Outstanding Alumni should be taken on board in collaboration with the University of Guyana Guild of Graduates/ Alumni Association.

                                A University orator should be identified and appointed to create and read citations of special awardees.

                                In a similar mode, it is recommended that the University identify for special citation and the awards of a Plaque, those corporate bodies or agencies that have been useful and particularly helpful over the years.

                                Selection might be made not simply according to the size of the financial and technical assistance granted but also according to the consistency and frequency of the help given. This should be considered in tandem with the University’s branding policy and naming policy.
